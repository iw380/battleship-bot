# battleship-bot
  A simple implementation of Battleship and an algorithm for it. Old project I did with Adrian Pan [https://github.com/adrian-pan]. 

We used the standard 10x10 board and 5 ships of lengths 5, 4, 3, 3, and 2. Click and drag on your grid to place ships and select tiles on the bot's grid to attack. The button on the bottom left displays the Heatmap that the bot uses to calculate its moves.
